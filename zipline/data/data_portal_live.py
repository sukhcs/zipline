        Public API method that returns a scalar value representing the value

        Parameters
        ----------
        assets : Asset
            The asset or assets whose data is desired. This cannot be
            an arbitrary AssetConvertible.

        dt : pd.Timestamp
            The timestamp for the desired value.
        data_frequency : str
            The frequency of the data to query; i.e. whether the data is
            'daily' or 'minute' bars

        Returns
        -------
